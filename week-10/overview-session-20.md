# Session-20

Tonight we spent class asking and responding to questions! See the list of questions with responses, helpful resources, and zoom recordings below.

## Questions:

**Question:** _Can I see the way how to do the Fibonacci stack in JavaScript?_

  - [Fibonacci stack solution example](https://replit.com/@dangeranger/fibonacci-examples#index.js)

**Question:** _I'm interested in learning Ruby on Rails. Is that something I could jump right into, or do I need a bit more experience first._
  - Before moving on to learning a whole other language, we recommend honing in on building out your JavaScript skills first.
  - Ruby on Rails is fun! It is also very big and there's a lot to learn.
  - You can certainly get up and running, but it takes some time to fully understand how it works.
  - There are a lot of open source materials for learning Ruby on Rails

**Question:** _If interested in web and app development, what would be the next step in taking classes_

Upcoming BCA/Upright Bootcamp opportunities:

- [24 week part-time Software Development Bootcamp](https://burlingtoncodeacademy.com/24-week-software-development-bootcamp)

- [12 week full-time Software Development Bootcamp](https://burlingtoncodeacademy.com/software-development-bootcamp)

Other education/community support resources to explore:

- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript)

- [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript)

- [C0D3](https://www.c0d3.com/)

**Question:** _What advice would you have for someone enrolled in the bootcamp? This could be content-specific, or more general like habits and strategies that will make things easier. Are there specific skills we should work on in preparation?_

- Trust the process, be patient with yourself, and believe that you can do it!
- Take breaks...sometime you've just got to walk away from buggy code
- Don't be afraid to ask all your questions, you deserve to get what you need in order to succeed!
- Build relationships with fellow students and lean on your community for support

**Question:** _What are some ways to explore different career paths within software development?_

- Research job descriptions for different titles/roles and see what sounds compelling to you.

- Reach out to people on LinkedIn! Reach out to BCA alum!! Have conversations with folks who are currently in different roles to learn more.

- Find a job that you are happy working, that enables you to pay the bills, and offers a supportive team that will help you foster your learning and growth!

**Question:** _If building websites for other people. They're going to want to be able to update the site on their own. Does that essentially mean using content management systems. What systems do you recommend?_

- Yes. Remember that you will be working with your client and getting them set up to use it themselves. There are different CMS options to meet different needs. See a couple below:

  - WordPress (WP is a massive system and have to know PHP)
  - Squarespace (low code with options to customize)

**Question:** _If you could give your early coder self advice, what would it be?_

- Take more chances; be brave!
- Take more notes
- Write down questions that emerged along the way of building projects
- Document your learning along the way, write down what you accomplished
- Code notation is actually really important
- Taking it slow; take breaks
- Remember that learning takes place outside the comfort zone, or at least on the edge of your comfort zone

**Here are some additional resources to learn more about**:
