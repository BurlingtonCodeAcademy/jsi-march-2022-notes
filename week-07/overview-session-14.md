# Session-14

Tonight we learned more about **HTML** and **CSS**!

### HTML

**Attributes**
Attributes further define HTML elements and their purpose. For example, an image tag may have the following attributes:

```js
<img src="/images/cat-pic.jpg" title="Cat Picture" alt="Picture of a fuzzy cat">
```

- `src` defines where the image file is located.
- `alt` is alternative text to be displayed if the image cannot be.
- Attributes are not always required. However in the example above, a source is needed for the image to be displayed.
- Others include `style` (for inline CSS), `title` (for hover-over tooltips), `href` (hyperlink reference)
- Attribute names should always be lowercase

**Tables**

- Tables are a way of structuring data into rows and columns.
- Tables are comprised 4 elements:
  - `<table>` => defines an HTML table
  - `<tr>` => table row
  - `<th>` => table height
  - `<td>` => table data

**Lists**

- Two main types of HTML lists: ordered and unordered.

- `<ul>` describes a unordered list. Each item in the list will be bulleted.

```js
<ul>
  <li>Pizza</li>
  <li>Pasta</li>
  <li>Bread</li>
</ul>
```

- `<ol>` describes an ordered list. Each item in the list will be numbered (top to bottom)

```js
<ol>
  <li>Pizza</li>
  <li>Pasta</li>
  <li>Bread</li>
</ol>
```

**Comments are our friend in HTML!**

- Commenting is important in any form of coding.
- Comments help both you and others to better understand the intent of the code.
- Especially helpful when reviewing large amounts of code.
- Comments in HTML are not read by browsers. They use the following syntax:
<!-- This is a comment! -->

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- CSS, by itself, does nothing.
- Responsible for determining how your HTML looks
- CSS formats your webpage. Without it, there is only content, and no structure or styles.

**Writing CSS**

- _Can_ be written within HTML, but it's **best practice** to write CSS in an external style sheet

- Creating external style sheets prevents you from having to write code multiple times, and makes it easy to modify.

**Styling with CSS**

- Using CSS properties, you can modify the appearance of your HTML.
- This can done by targeting HTML elements.

**Example:**
Let's say we have the following HTML:

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Cat</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>My Cat Bob</h1>
    <p>My cat is named Bob. He is a lazy cat.</p>
  </body>
</html>

```

Below is an example of **CSS targeting the HTML elements** from the example above:

```css
h1 {
  color: red;
  font-size: 24px;
}

p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

**Adding styles to an HTML page**
Common use-cases to add style to an HTML page include:

- `<h1 style="color: red; font-size: 32px;">` Inline
- `<link>` Tag to a CSS file
- `<style>` Tags with `@import` of a CSS file

**Selectors and Properties**

- CSS is constructed of selectors and properties.
- Selectors determine where the styles are applied.
- Properties determine what those styles are.
- CSS begins with a selector, followed by curly braces.
- Declare your styles inside the curly braces.

```css
p {
  color: white; // =>text color
  background-color: navy; // => background color
  text-align: center; // => justifies text
  font-size: 24px; // => size of font
  border: 5px grey solid; // => Defines border width, style, and color
}
```

^ In the above example, `p` is the selector with the styles declared within the curly braces.

**Compound Selectors - Example #1**
Selectors can target elements nested within other elements:

```css
p img {
  max-width: 320px;
  height: auto;
}
```

**Compound Selectors - Example #2**
Selectors can target specific elements with a class:

```css
h1 .title {
  display: block;
  margin: 0, auto;
  padding-top: 1em;
}
```

^ In the example above, we are applying the styling to any element with the `class="title"`

**Compound Selectors - Example #3**
Selectors can target specific elements with several layers of nesting

```css
main .introduction > p {
  background-color: lightgray;
  margin: 10px auto;
}
```

_The above example says:_ "apply these styles to all ps that are direct children of a div of class introduction inside the main section"

**Psuedo-Class Selectors**
You can target the state of an element using psuedo-class selectors

```css
a:hover {
  background-color: red;
}

a:active {
  background-color: green;
}
```
