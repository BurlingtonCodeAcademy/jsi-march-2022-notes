# Session*13

Tonight we ...

* Workshopped various solutions for the `tag-search` lab
* Reviewed **state machines** and **lookup tables** 
    * Remember: a lookup table is an object consisting of key*value pairs wherein the key is always a `string`. The power of a lookup table is that it ties our strings (`keys`)to our associated variable names (`values`).
* Introduction to HTML!!
* Introduction to **"ZORKINGTON"!!!** This project is **DUE: Tuesday, June 26th**

### HTML
`HTML`is a coding language composed of various types of tags, also known as elements. These are what are used to build web pages.

* Stands for Hyper*Text Markup Language
* Every HTML file is one web page
* Invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee
* Based on SGML
* Standard language used for creating web pages
* Composed of tags
* CSS and JavaScript are designed to work in tandem with HTML
* HTML is for structuring content. **It does not perform complex computations.**

**HTML Standard Page Structure**

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My House</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>My house is a very very very fine
     house, with two cats in the yard.</p>
    <p>Life used to be <strong>so
     hard</strong>; now everything is
     easy cause of you.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
**Note**: A quick and easy way to **set up your HTML page** with the basic file structure set*up, simply use the following commands:
`!` + `Enter`

**Elements (aka Tags)**
As you can see in the example above, all HTML tags are surrounded by angle brackets. You can also see that every tag has what is known as a closing tag. It is mostly true that every HTML tag needs to have a closing tag.

**Commonly used tags**
| tag    |	meaning                  |
| * | :*:|
| <head> |	head (contains metadata) |
| <body> |	page body                |
| <div>  |	division                 |
| <h1>   |	Heading (level 1)        |   
| <p>    |	Paragraph containing text|
| <span> |	Text without a line break|
| <img>  |	Image tag                |
| <link> |	Link tag                 |
| <style>|	style tag                |

**Example of style tags**
| tag           |	meaning                         |
| * | :*:|
| <b>           |	bold                            |
| <i>           |	italic                          |
| <strong>      |	**strong**                      |
| <em>          |	_emphasis_                      |   
| <br>          |	Line break                      |
| <hr>          |	horizontal ruling               |
| <blockquote>  |	Horizontal rule (dividing line) |

**Inspect Your Page**
The **Inspect** tool enables you to take a look under the hood of _any_ webpage and see how that page is structured with various HTML elements. The Inspector is a powerful tool that we will continue to explore.
