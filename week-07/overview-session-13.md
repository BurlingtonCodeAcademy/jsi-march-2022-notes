# Session-13

Tonight we ...

- Workshopped various solutions for the **"tag-search" lab**
- Reviewed **state machines** and **lookup tables**
  - A Lookup table is an object consisting of key-value pairs wherein the key is always a `string`.
- Introduction to **HTML**
- Introduction to **"ZORKINGTON"!!!** This project is **DUE: Tuesday, June 26th**

### HTML

**HTML** is a coding language composed of various types of tags, also known as elements. These are what are used to build web pages.

- Stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language
- Every HTML file is one web page
- Invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee
- Based on SGML
- Standard language used for creating web pages
- Composed of tags
- CSS and JavaScript are designed to work in tandem with HTML
- HTML is for structuring content. **It does not perform complex computations.**

**HTML Standard Page Structure**

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My House</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>My house is a very very very fine
     house, with two cats in the yard.</p>
    <p>Life used to be <strong>so
     hard</strong>; now everything is
     easy cause of you.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Note**: A quick and easy way to **set up your HTML page** with the basic file structure set-up, simply use the following commands:
`! Enter`

**HTML Elements (aka Tags)**
As you can see in the example above, all HTML tags are surrounded by angle brackets. You can also see that every tag has what is known as a closing tag. It is mostly true that every HTML tag needs to have a closing tag.

**Inspect Your Page**
The **Inspect** tool enables you to take a look under the hood of _any_ webpage and see how that page is structured with various HTML elements. The Inspector is a powerful tool that we will continue to explore.
