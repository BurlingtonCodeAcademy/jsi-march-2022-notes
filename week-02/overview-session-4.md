## Practice

### Variable Lab: Play in Console

Let's spend a few minutes just playing around with variables in the JavaScript console.

Some things to try:

- assign your birth year to a variable, then calculate your current age in years
- write a poem (with at least two lines) and assign it to a variable
- print the poem to the console with proper line formatting
- assign your best friend's name to a variable
- YELL YOUR BEST FRIEND'S NAME
- get a new best friend
- and YELL THEIR NAME TOO

### [More Function Practice Labs](https://github.com/BurlingtonCodeAcademy/jsah-june-2021-notes/blob/main/week-2/session-4/labs/more_function_practice.md)

>HINT: for Titalize lab, recall that
>
> - the method `.split(' ')` will split a string on its spaces and create an array
>
```js
let words = "all dogs are good dogs".split(' ')
```
>
> - You can access an element of an array by using square brackets `[]`
>
```js
let myArray = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
myArray[0] // a
myArray[1] // b
myArray[3] // d
```
