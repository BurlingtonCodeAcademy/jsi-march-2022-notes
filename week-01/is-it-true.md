# Is It True Lab

## Welcome

Use the conditional statement below to answer the following questions, so that you can understand the *truthiness* of each expression.

If the value is `true` it will print `It is truthy` to the console, otherwise nothing will print.

```js
if (true) {
  console.log('it is truthy');
}
```

## Booleans

* Is the boolean `true` truthy?
* Is the boolean `false` truthy?

## Strings

Try replacing `true` with a string. Is it truthy?

## Numbers

Try replacing `true` with a number. Is it truthy?

* What about the number `0`?
* What about `NaN`?

## Expression Evaluation

Try replacing `true` with the expression `1 < 2`.

* What happens if you switch the operator so the expression reads `1 > 2`
