# Is It True?

## Welcome!
Given the conditional below, answer the following questions to understand the *truthiness* of each expression. If the check (currently the boolean true) is `true` it will print `It is truthy` to the console, otherwise nothing will print.

```js
if(true){
    console.log('it is truthy')
}
```

## Booleans
- Is the boolean `true` truthy?
- Is the boolean `false` truthy?

## Strings
Try replacing `true` with a string. Is it truthy?

## Numbers
Try replacing `true` with a number. Is it truthy?
- What about the number `0`?
- What about `NaN`?

## Expression Evaluation
Try replacing `true` with the expression `1 < 2`.
- What happens if you switch the operator so the expression reads `1 > 2`
