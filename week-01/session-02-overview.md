## Text Editor: Visual Studio Code

The text editor we will be using in this course is Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

[How to setup Save/Auto Save in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics#:~:text=By%20default%2C%20VS%20Code%20requires,when%20focus%20leaves%20the%20editor).


GJ recommends `onFocusChange` as an auto save preference

## A note on VS Code's terminal

VS Code's terminal is simply sending commands you enter, and their results to whatever command-line you have configured it to use. So by default it uses PowerShell on Windows, but it can use GitBash if you set it to do so. On MacOS it uses the default shell, which is either Bash, or Zsh.

## Make it work; make it right; make it better (in that order)

1. Make it work -- This is most important! Make sure your program is working.
2. Make it right -- Make sure your program is accomplishing what you want it to.
3. Make it better -- Is there a way to restructure your code so as to improve operation without altering functionality?
