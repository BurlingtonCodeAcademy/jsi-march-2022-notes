## House Keeping

From here on out, primary form of communication will be through discord. Please use our discord channel to share all your questions!

Class recordings are typically shared a few days after each class session.

## Keep In Mind

Users are our greatest teachers! They will break your program and you'll learn how to build it better!

There is no right way to find the answer/solve the problem...everyone can/will approach it differently-- This differentiation is part of what makes coding so exciting!

*Pattern recognition* is foundational to *Programmatic Thinking*. It can take time to build up this muscle and that's more than ok!

Errors can be frustrating, but have no fear! An error message allows us to better understand what needs to be fixed and how to fix it.

## Fun Facts

The very first reported *bug* was actually in 1947: a moth was trapped in the computer, oh my!

## CLI vs GUI

CLI is the Command Line Interface. The Command Line allows you to talk directly with your computer to access files/directories. It is primitive and powerful.

GUI (pronounced: "Goo-ey") is the Graphic User Interface.
